# Data_Science - Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of Machine Learning algorithms organized by Supervised Learning methods, along with links to respective GitHub repositories for each algorithm.

## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for predictions. It is divided into two types:

### 1. Classification

 **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** - [Disease_prediction](https://github.com/kanish-20/Disease_prediction.git)
 
 **Random forest** - [Student_result](https://github.com/kanish-20/Student_performance_predictor.git)
 
 **Logistic Regression** - [Loan_Approval](https://github.com/kanish-20/Loan_approval_predictor.git)
 
 **Suuport Vector Machine(SVM)** - [Spam_detection](https://github.com/kanish-20/Spam_detection.git)

 ### 2. Regression

 **Linear Regression** - [House_price](https://github.com/kanish-20/house-price-predictor.git)
