# Data_Science - Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of Machine Learning algorithms organized by Supervised and Unsupervised Learning methods, along with links to respective GitHub repositories for each algorithm.

## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for predictions. It is divided into two types:

### 1. Classification

 **Decision tree** - [Diabetes_Preiction](https://github.com/kanish-20/Diabetes_predictor.git)
 
 **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** - [Disease_prediction](https://github.com/kanish-20/Disease_prediction.git)
 
 **Random forest** - [Student_result](https://github.com/kanish-20/Student_performance_predictor.git)
 
 **Logistic Regression** - [Loan_Approval](https://github.com/kanish-20/Loan_approval_predictor.git)
 
 **Suuport Vector Machine(SVM)** - [Spam_detection](https://github.com/kanish-20/Spam_detection.git)

 **Naive Bayes** - [Sentiment_analysis](https://github.com/kanish-20/Sentiment_analysis.git)
 
 **Gradiant Boosting** - [Customer_churn_prediction](https://github.com/kanish-20/Customer_churn_pred.git)

 ### 2. Regression

 **Linear Regression** - [House_price](https://github.com/kanish-20/house-price-predictor.git)

 **Lasso Regression** - [Car_price](https://github.com/kanish-20/Car_price_prediction.git)

 **Ridge Regression** - [Laptop_price](https://github.com/kanish-20/Laptop_price.git)

 # Unspervised Learning

 Unsupervised learning uses unlabeled data to find patterns and relationships.

 ### 1. Clustering

  **K-Means** â€“ [Customer_segmentation](https://github.com/kanish-20/Customer_segmentation.git)

  **Hierarchical Clustering** -
