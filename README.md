# Data_Science - Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of Machine Learning algorithms organized by Supervised Learning methods, along with links to respective GitHub repositories for each algorithm.

## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled data to train models for predictions. It is divided into two types:

### 1. Classification

 **Decision tree** - [Diabetes_Preiction](https://github.com/kanish-20/Diabetes_predictor.git)
 **KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)** - [Disease_prediction](
 **Random forest** - 
 **Logistic Regression** -

 ### 2. Regression

 **Linear Regression** -
